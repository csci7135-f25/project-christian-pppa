# project/paper

This subfolder contains the project report. To build the paper, run `make`.

This will produce a single PDF, main.pdf. 

`main.tex` contains all of the writing and figures. `defs.tex` and `macros.tex` contain auxiliary definitions and macros, to prevent pollution of the writing. 

`ref.bib` contains all references. Remaining files are for the ACMART format.
